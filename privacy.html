    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

    <p>
      Local Journal is designed to be private by default. This app does not require accounts,
      does not collect personal data, and does not transmit your journal entries to any servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      All journal entries, settings, and preferences are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
      Local Journal does not upload, sync, or back up your data to the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because your data never leaves your device, we cannot access, view, or recover your journal entries.
    </p>

    <h2>Accounts and Identity</h2>
    <p>
      Local Journal does <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account.
      We do not collect names, email addresses, usernames, or any other identifying information.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics, Tracking, and Ads</h2>
    <p>
      Local Journal does <strong>not</strong> use analytics services, advertising networks, trackers,
      or third-party SDKs that collect behavioral or usage data.
    </p>
    <p>We do not track how you use the app.</p>

    <h2>App Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      Local Journal only requests permissions that are necessary for core functionality, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Local storage access (to save your entries on your device)</li>
      <li>Biometric or device-level authentication (if you enable app lock)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used entirely on-device and are never shared externally.</p>

    <h2>App Lock and Security</h2>
    <p>
      If enabled, app lock uses your device’s existing PIN, pattern, or biometric security.
      Local Journal does not create or store separate passwords.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Export</h2>
    <p>
      You may export your journal entries at any time as text or JSON files.
      Exported files are created locally and remain under your control.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Local Journal does not integrate with third-party services that process your data.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Local Journal does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children.
      Since no data is collected or transmitted, there is no user profiling or data retention.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be made available on this page.
      Changes will not retroactively affect your existing data, which always remains on your device.
    </p>
